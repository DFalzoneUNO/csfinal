    some very vague likelihoods about their biological constraints. So, like any

    signal: the number 137, approximately equal to the reciprocal of the fine
    structure constant, expressed as an unsigned base-2 integer using timed pulses.
    You broadcast the 137 signal at high power on a wide range of radio frequencies

    "On the planet's surface, various troops of bipedal apes begin to notice unusually
    strong radio interference from a particular point in the sky. Initially, a few
    astronomers hypothesize that it might be from a nearby newly formed pulsar with a
    highly eccentric axis of rotation, but this is quickly ruled out, first by the fact
    that the signal has a high amplitude over a wide range of radio frequencies, then by
    the fact that the signal appears to be a binary representation of 137 on a loop, and
    then by the fact that the signal's point of origin is a round metal object in a stable
    low orbit. World leaders around the globe hold emergency meetings to discuss how to
    prepare for the public response to the unexpected arrival of alien life to the Earth.

    You, the alien life, don't know about any of that yet. However, your receiver picks
    up a cacophony of amateur radio enthusiasts, most of whom are imitating the 137 signal
    back, confirming that the planet definitely hosts intelligent life with willingness
    and ability to communicate."
